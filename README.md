# Multi-Robot-Disaster-Rescue
Disaster cause economic and social loses. Using robots can bring many benefits.  We provide a Co-operative SLAM strategy to effectively use robotic swarms for faster mapping. In SLAM strategy, a sub-division of map through cooperation  is created by particle SLAM (FAST SLAM) and then centralize map to best utilize robotic swarm by updating at every loop closure.
